# Unleash the Power of Azure Open AI

![](/images/intro.png)

ChatGPT has grown explosively in popularity as we all know now. Business users across the globe often tap into the public service to work more productively or act as a creative assistant.

However, ChatGPT risks exposing confidential intellectual property. One option is to block corporate access to ChatGPT, but people always find workarounds. This also limits the powerful capabilities of ChatGPT and reduces employee productivity and their work experience.

ChatGPT on Azure solution accelerator is our enterprise option. This solution provides similar user experience to ChatGPT but offered as your private ChatGPT.

### Benefits are:

**1. Private:** Built-in guarantees around the privacy of your data and fully isolated from those operated by OpenAI.

**2. Controlled:** Network traffic can be fully isolated to your network and other enterprise grade security controls are built in.

**3. Value:** Deliver added business value with your own internal data sources (plug and play) or use plug-ins to integrate with your internal services (e.g., ServiceNow, etc).

We've built a Solution Accelerator to empower your workforce with ChatGPT on Azure solution accelerator.

# Azure Deployment Costs

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
However, you can try the [Azure pricing calculator - Sample Estimate for Azure Chat App](https://azure.com/e/1f08b35661df4b5ea3663df112250b09) for the resources below. The total monthly cost for the provided example is $372.33.

- Azure App Service: Premium V3 Tier 1 CPU core, 4 GB RAM, 250 GB Storage. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/)
- Azure Open AI: Standard tier, ChatGPT and Embedding models. Pricing per 1K tokens used, and at least 1K tokens are used per question. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Form Recognizer: SO (Standard) tier using pre-built layout. Pricing per document page, sample documents have 261 pages total. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/form-recognizer/)
- Azure Cognitive Search: Standard tier, 1 replica, free level of semantic search. Pricing per hour.[Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/)
- Azure Cosmos DB: Standard provisioned throughput with ZRS (Zone-redundant storage). Pricing per storage and read operations. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cosmos-db/autoscale-provisioned/)
- Azure Monitor: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)

To reduce costs, you can switch to free SKUs for Azure App Service, Azure Cognitive Search, and Form Recognizer by changing the parameters file under the `./infra` folder. There are some limits to consider; for example, you can have up to 1 free Cognitive Search resource per subscription, and the free Form Recognizer resource only analyzes the first 2 pages of each document. You can also reduce costs associated with the Form Recognizer by reducing the number of documents you upload.

⚠️ To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to destroy your provisioned resources by deleting the resource group.
